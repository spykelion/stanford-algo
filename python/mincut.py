#The file contains the adjacency list representation of a simple undirected graph.
#There are 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200. The first column in the file represents the vertex label,
#and the particular row (other entries except the first column) tells all the vertices
#that the vertex is adjacent to. So for example, the $$6^{th}$$ row looks like : "6	155	56	52	120	......".
#This just means that the vertex with label 6 is adjacent
#to (i.e., shares an edge with) the vertices with labels 155,56,52,120,......,etc


#Your task is to code up and run the randomized contraction algorithm for the min cut problem
#and use it on the above graph to compute the min cut.
#(HINT: Note that you'll have to figure out an implementation of edge contractions.
#Initially, you might want to do this naively, creating a new graph from the old every time
#there's an edge contraction.  But you should also think about more efficient implementations.)
#(WARNING: As per the video lectures, please make sure to run the algorithm many times
#with different random seeds, and remember the smallest cut that you ever find.)
#Write your numeric answer in the space provided.  So e.g., if your answer is 5, just type 5 in the space provided
